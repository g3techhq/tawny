# AGENTS.md

Instructions for coding agents working in this repository (Claude Code, Codex,
Cursor, Copilot, and anything else that reads `AGENTS.md`). Useful for people
too. Follow these over your defaults.

## What this is

**Tawny** is a calm, self-hosted YouTube client: a subscription feed, search,
channels, playlists, a queue and history, and a persistent player, with no
Piped instance in between. The server talks to YouTube directly (rustypipe,
official RSS and WebSub) and resolves playable streams through a yt-dlp
sidecar. It is one Rust codebase for web (WASM), Android, iOS and desktop,
built on the **g3 stack** (the same shape as
[g3-stack](https://github.com/g3techhq/g3-stack)).

**Your training data is probably wrong about these.** Dioxus 0.7 changed server
functions, assets and signals from earlier versions, and the g3 crates are new.
Read the linked doc before writing code against a library, not after it fails
to compile. Prefer the patterns already in `src/` over what you remember.

### Domain terms

- **Channel, video**: the shared catalog, normalized from YouTube into the
  `channel` and `video` tables. A video can be a **Short** or **live**; the
  feed filters on that (`FeedFilter`).
- **Follow** (a subscription): a `user_subscription` edge from an account to a
  channel, with a **`SubscriptionContent`** (videos, Shorts, or both).
  **Groups** sort follows into feed filters.
- **Feed**: the followed channels' uploads, 24 at a time
  (`get_feed_page(query, page)`), filtered in SurrealDB.
- **Playlist**: an account's ordered list (`playlist` + `playlist_item`). The
  **queue** is a list of video ids and playlist runs (`playlist:<id>`
  entries); **history** is the last 250 videos opened.
- **Viewer**: one account's own state, read by almost every screen
  (`get_viewer`): follows, playlists as ids, groups, queue, history.
- **Settings** (`AppSettings`): per device, in local storage, not the server.
- **Playback session**: what the server resolves for one video
  (`PlaybackSession` of `PlaybackSource`s), served to the player through a
  same-origin proxy with short-lived tokens.
- **Extractor sidecar**: the yt-dlp service in `docker/extractor`, with its
  bgutil PO-token provider. **WebSub**: YouTube's push notifications for new
  uploads.

## Map

```
src/app.rs              Route enum + transitions + theme. Read first.
src/state.rs            AppState: the viewer, settings, the player, overlays
src/data_change.rs      What each kind of mutation makes stale in the client cache
src/main.rs             Server: DB, layers, the session-less routes, router
src/server_url.rs       The backend address, chosen before launch (native builds)
src/health.rs           Container probe, outside the session layers
src/auth/               Accounts and sessions (g3-auth), and the client's session
src/db/                 Connection and schema sync
src/api/                Server functions by area: catalog, playback, feed, account, library
src/server/             AppServerState, the server's engine: ytdlp, youtube (normalizing),
                        resolve, proxy, segments, store, browse, feed, websub, viewer
src/models/             Types shared by client and server
src/components/         Screens and the shell; player.rs is the persistent player
src/cache.rs            use_persistent_signal (per-device settings)
src/subscriptions_io.rs Importing and exporting subscription lists
assets/                 tawny_transport.js and tawny_player_controls.js (the player's JS side)
database/schema/        One .surql file per table (desired state, not migrations)
docker/extractor/       The yt-dlp sidecar image
docs/                   Human and agent documentation; docs/dioxus/ for the framework
tests/                  Node tests for the player JS; tests/ui for Playwright
```

`src/api/library.rs` (`set_in_playlist`) with the playlist screens in
`src/components/playlists.rs` is a compact example of a change end to end: a
"set to" server function, an optimistic `update_cached`, and a `DataChange`.

## Commands

```bash
just check        # web + server + mobile + desktop type-check. `cargo check` alone is NOT enough
just test         # Node + Rust tests, web + server
just lint         # clippy (web, server) + biome
just lint-strict  # clippy on all four builds with warnings as errors, as CI runs it
just format       # rustfmt + biome
just db-up        # SurrealDB and the extractor sidecars in Docker
just dev          # dev server, http://localhost:8080
just test-ui      # Playwright
```

## Definition of done

Before you say a change is finished:

1. `just check` passes, on all four feature sets.
2. `just test` passes.
3. `just lint-strict` is clean.
4. For UI changes, you looked at it in a browser at **390×844**, and at
   **1440×900** if layout changed, and read the `dx serve` output for server
   errors. See "Verifying in a browser" below.

If you could not do one of these, say which and why.

## Rules

### UI: g3-ui first

- **Build screens from g3-ui components.** A page is `PageHeader` (the app's
  wrapper over g3-ui's `Header`) + `Content`, a block is a `Card`, a row is an
  `Item`, a vertical flow is a `Stack`, copy is `Text { variant, tone }`, an
  empty or failed state is an `EmptyState`. Grids of videos are `VideoGrid`.
  The catalog is [docs/g3-ui.md](docs/g3-ui.md).
- **Do not add CSS classes or rules** for things a component or prop already
  does. Tailwind is for layout only.
- **No color literals** outside `tawny_theme` in `src/app.rs`.
- **No viewport media queries.** Use `@container g3-app-shell (width >= 48rem)`.
- Stateful g3-ui components take an owned `Signal` and write it.
- Feedback goes through `app_state.show_toast(..)`.
- Icon-only buttons need `aria_label`.

### Components, props and hooks

The full guide, with examples from this code, is
[docs/dioxus/patterns.md](docs/dioxus/patterns.md).

- **Hooks run unconditionally, in the same order, every render.** All `use_*`
  calls before any early `return`, the player's included.
- **Never hold a signal borrow across `.await`.** Copy the value first.
  `clippy.toml` lints for it.
- **A prop read inside a hook is a `ReadSignal<T>`.** No `use_reactive!`.
- **Derived values are `use_memo`**, and lists are copied when their data
  changes, not on every render (`VideoGrid` takes a `ReadSignal<Vec<Video>>`).
- **Never write a signal while rendering.** Derive with `use_memo`; write from
  `use_effect` or a handler.
- **Handlers a page passes as props are `use_callback`s** when the page
  re-renders often, reading what they need when they run. A closure rebuilt
  on every render and passed as an optional handler has panicked in
  `Callback::__point_to` (see patterns.md).
- **Borrow the one setting you need**: `app_state.settings.read().theater_mode`,
  not `app_state.settings()`, which clones the whole struct.
- Format with `cargo fmt`. Do not run `dx fmt` 0.7.9: it corrupts closures
  inside `rsx!`.

### Reading and changing data

- **Screens read through `use_cached(server_fn, (args,))`**, which shows the
  last answer at once (IndexedDB on web, redb on native) and refetches behind
  it. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#data-on-the-client).
- **A change is shown at once, then made on the server, then reconciled**:
  `update_cached` the reads it touches, call the "set to" server function,
  then `data_change::invalidate(..)` for what it could have affected.
- **Mutations say "set to", not "toggle"** (`set_in_playlist(id, video,
  true)`), so a stale device cannot undo another's change. The queue is sent
  whole.
- The client never holds the catalog. A screen asks for what it shows.

### Server

- Server functions live in `src/api/`, one file per area, and call methods on
  `AppServerState` (`src/server/`). Paths are under `/api/v1/`.
- **The account comes from the session** (`Owner`), never from an argument.
- **Bind values** in SurrealQL. Never `format!` a value into a query.
- **YouTube is volatile.** Extraction goes through `src/server/youtube.rs`
  (normalizing rustypipe) and `ytdlp.rs` (the sidecar); a failure falls back
  to the stale server cache, then to what the device last saw, never an error
  page. Stream URLs and PO tokens are never persisted.
- Guarded by default: `#[g3_auth::public]` only for guest creation, sign-in
  and sign-out, and a test pins that list. Health, the playback proxy and the
  WebSub callback are mounted outside the session layers on purpose.
- Server caches are `g3_cache::ServerCache` statics, bounded and expiring.

### SurrealDB

- Schema changes go in `database/schema/<table>.surql` with `IF NOT EXISTS`;
  the server applies them on start. `database/presync.surql` and
  `backfill.surql` run around the sync for data moves.
- Tests use an in-memory database (`kv-mem`).

### Cross-platform

- `src/` compiles four ways: web, server, mobile and desktop. Server-only code
  sits behind `#[cfg(feature = "server")]`.
- **Gate calls, never markup.** The server renders HTML the client hydrates.
- The player is JS as much as Rust: `assets/tawny_transport.js` (Shaka, the
  proxy, retries) and `tawny_player_controls.js`, with Node tests in `tests/`.
  Keep the Rust ↔ JS message shapes in step (`sync_player_metadata`,
  `attach_player_session`).

### Code style

- Comment **why**, not what. The existing comments set the tone and density.
- Prefer a Rust unit test over a browser test; server tests run against
  `mem://`. One test talks to YouTube and is `#[ignore]`d.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits; lefthook checks them.

## Verifying in a browser

```bash
just db-up
just dev                  # or reuse a server already on :8080
```

- Check `http://127.0.0.1:8080` first; reuse a running server rather than
  starting a second one. If you start one, stop only that one afterward.
- Non-interactive start: `dx serve --web --addr 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --open false --interactive false`.
- Set the viewport to **390×844** before interacting.
- A first visit signs in as a new guest automatically, with the demo channels
  and playlists. A new guest's first requests can log `401` before the cookie
  lands; they retry.
- **Stop the dev server before editing Rust.** dx tries to hot-patch the
  running app and can leave a wasm that imports `env`; the page then stays on
  "Loading". If that happens, run
  `cargo clean -p tawny --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile wasm-dev`,
  delete `target/dx`, and start again.
- Read the `dx serve` output for `[500]`s and panics, and the page for the
  `App panicked!` overlay.
