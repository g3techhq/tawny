# Authentication

Sessions, guests and accounts. The code is `src/auth/` (`accounts.rs` on the server, `session.rs` on the client) and the guard in `src/main.rs`.

Sessions come from `g3-auth`, the same stack as Greenside Partee and Media Mancer: cookie sessions stored in SurrealDB, resolved to an `app_user` (`auth::AppUser`) on every request. First launch creates a guest account, seeded with the demo follows and the default playlists; registration promotes that row in place. Native clients initialize the Dioxus cookie runtime before launch, so the cookie stays outside application state.

The guard (`g3_auth::require_session`) refuses every server function without a signed-in account unless it is marked `#[g3_auth::public]`: only guest creation, sign-in and sign-out are, and a test pins that list. Every page is public, because the client signs a first visit in from whichever page it opened. Health, the playback proxy and the WebSub callback sit outside the session layers: probes and YouTube's hub have no cookie, and a proxy token is itself the capability, fetched by native media elements without the app's cookie.

Sessions name their account by its record key. Sessions written before g3-auth named it `app_user:<key>`; `database/presync.surql` rewrites those on start, so a signed-in device stays signed in.

## The endpoints

| Server function | Public | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_guest_account` | yes | Makes a guest, seeded with the demo follows and default playlists, and signs it in |
| `register_account` | no | Promotes the signed-in guest to an email account, in place |
| `sign_in_to_account` | yes | Email and password (argon2 hashes, in `auth/accounts.rs`); replaces the session's account |
| `sign_out_of_account` | yes | Ends the session; the client starts a new guest |
| `current_account` | no | Who is signed in |

Credentials are checked by `validate_email` and `validate_password` in
`src/models/account.rs`, shared by the form and the server.

## On the client

Every read answers `401` until a session exists, so the session is set up
above the UI: `use_session_provider` (`src/auth/session.rs`), called from
`AppStateProvider`, asks for the current account and creates a guest when
there is none, then refetches every cached read once. A new guest's very first
requests can therefore log `401` before the cookie lands; they are retried.

The client cache is keyed to the signed-in account and emptied when it
changes (`g3_cache::set_cache_owner`).
