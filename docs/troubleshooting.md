# Troubleshooting

Problems people hit in this app, roughly in the order they hit them. The
Dioxus-specific ones are explained further in
[dioxus/patterns.md](dioxus/patterns.md).

---

## Setup

**`dx and dioxus versions are incompatible`**
The CLI and the `dioxus` crate must be the same version. `Cargo.toml` pins
`=0.7.9`: `cargo binstall dioxus-cli@0.7.9 --force`.

**`Failed to connect to the database`**
The services are not running, or `.env` points elsewhere. `just db-up`, then
check `SURREALDB_HOST`/`SURREALDB_PORT` in `.env` (Compose publishes
SurrealDB on `127.0.0.1:8001`).

**Search, channels or playback fail with extractor errors**
The yt-dlp sidecar or its PO-token provider is down. `docker compose ps`
should show `extractor` and `pot-provider` healthy; the extractor's health
check covers both. See [docker.md](docker.md).

---

## Building

**Works in `cargo check`, fails in CI**
`cargo check` builds only the web feature set. `just check` builds all four.

**Clippy: `this ... is held across an await point` (on a signal)**
A signal borrow is held across `.await`. Copy the value into a local first.

**`dx` builds break after setting `rust-lld` as the linker**
Do not set it on Windows.

---

## Running

**The page stays on "Loading" after an edit, and the console says
`Failed to resolve module specifier "env"`**
`dx serve` tried to hot-patch the running app and left a wasm build that
imports `env`. Stop the server, then:

```bash
cargo clean -p tawny --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --profile wasm-dev
```

delete `target/dx`, and start it again. Stop the server before editing Rust
to avoid it.

**`App panicked!` with `RefCell already borrowed` or a `ValueDroppedError`
from `Callback::__point_to`**
A handler passed as a prop was a closure rebuilt on every render of a page
that re-renders often. Make it a `use_callback` above any early return, reading
what it needs when it runs (see patterns.md, "Handlers"). To find which one,
add `generational-box = { version = "=0.7.10", features = ["debug_borrows"] }`
to `Cargo.toml` for a build: the panic then names where the value was made.

**A new guest's first requests show `401`**
They run before the session cookie lands, and are retried once it exists.
Anything that keeps failing with `401` is a server function missing from the
session's reach, not this.

**A screen shows stale data after a change made elsewhere**
The read is missing from the mutation's `DataChange` in `src/data_change.rs`.

**Every launch starts with an empty cache**
`g3_cache::set_cache_owner(None)` ran before the session was known.

**Playback stalls or fails**
See [playback.md](playback.md): the player reports the transport's own error.
Check the sidecar first, then the server log for the resolve.

## Mobile and desktop

**The app cannot reach the server on a device**
`localhost` on a phone is the phone. The Android emulator uses
`http://127.0.0.1:8080` through `adb reverse`; a physical device needs
`SERVER_URL` set to a reachable address. See [mobile.md](mobile.md).

**A changed backend address is ignored**
Dioxus 0.7 keeps the first server URL it is given; the app reloads to apply a
new one.
