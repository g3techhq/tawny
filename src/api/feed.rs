// Axum owns the opaque cookie and restores the account before each handler.
// The client never receives a session identifier to persist or replay.
//
// Errors come back as their rendered message. Field-level marking is done on
// the client with the shared validators in `models`, before the request is
// made; by the time the server refuses something, the only useful thing left to
// say is why.
