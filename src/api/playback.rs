// One account's own state, and the videos each screen shows. Reads are
// screen-sized; nothing here returns the catalog. Writes are "set to": a
// device showing stale state sends what it saw, and a toggle would undo
// another device's change.
//
// Complex arguments go over POST, since a GET query string cannot carry a
// struct; these reads are per-viewer and never cached anywhere but the
// device, so nothing is lost.
