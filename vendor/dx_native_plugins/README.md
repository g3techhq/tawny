# dx-native-plugins

Dioxus wrappers for native clipboard/share, Apple and Google auth hooks, external URLs, and deep-link metadata helpers.

The Cargo package is `dx-native-plugins`; the Rust crate name is `dx_native_plugins`.

## Install

Enable only the plugins your app uses:

```toml
[dependencies]
dx-native-plugins = { version = "0.1", features = ["clipboard", "auth", "external-url"] }
```

## Provide Plugins

Create the provider once near your app root. The provider lazily constructs each native plugin the first time it is used.

```rust,ignore
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dx_native_plugins::NativePluginsProvider;

#[component]
fn App() -> Element {
    rsx! { NativePluginsProvider { Outlet::<Route> {} } }
}
```

## Clipboard and Share

```rust,ignore
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dx_native_plugins::NativePlugins;

let mut plugins = use_context::<NativePlugins>();
plugins.clipboard.write().copy_to_clipboard("Invite copied".to_string())?;
plugins.clipboard.write().share("Join my game".to_string())?;
```

The web implementation uses the browser Clipboard and Web Share APIs. Android and iOS use the bundled Manganis FFI plugin sources under `src/android` and `src/ios`.

## Auth

Enable the `auth` feature to expose platform auth helpers:

```rust,ignore
let mut plugins = use_context::<NativePlugins>();

#[cfg(target_os = "android")]
let google = plugins.auth.write().start_google_auth()?;

#[cfg(any(target_os = "ios", target_os = "macos"))]
let apple = plugins.auth.write().start_apple_auth()?;
```

On iOS and macOS, Apple Sign In is asynchronous. Call `is_auth_awaiting()` and `poll_auth_result()` from your UI flow until a credential arrives or the flow ends.

## External URLs

```rust,ignore
let mut plugins = use_context::<NativePlugins>();
plugins.external_url.write().open("https://example.com")?;
```

## Deep-Link Metadata

The `deep_links` module is always available and generates `.well-known` JSON values:

```rust,ignore
dx_native_plugins::ios_app_site_association_route! {
    team_id: "TEAMID",
    bundle_id: "com.example.App",
    paths: ["/games/*/join"],
}

dx_native_plugins::android_asset_links_route! {
    package_name: "com.example.app",
    sha256_cert_fingerprints: ["AA:BB:CC"],
}
```

## System Back Button

Android delivers back to the Activity, never to the WebView, so a web app
hosted this way exits on the first press however it is written. The plugin
takes the press and turns it into `history.back()` — the same event a browser's
back button produces, so whatever the app already does for a traversal keeps
working.

Interception is off until asked for, because only the app knows whether there
is anywhere to go back to. Leaving it on at the root of the stack means the
user cannot leave.

```rust,ignore
use dioxus::prelude::*;
use dx_native_plugins::NativePlugins;

let mut plugins = use_context::<NativePlugins>();
let navigator = use_navigator();

// Re-run wherever the route changes.
use_effect(move || {
    let _ = plugins.back_button.write().set_intercepting(navigator.can_go_back());
});
```

iOS has no system back press and on the web the browser owns it, so both are
inert — callers need no `cfg` of their own.

The Android implementation resolves its Kotlin bridge through the Activity's
application class loader. This matters because Dioxus effects run on a native
thread, where JNI's default `FindClass` otherwise sees only the system loader.
